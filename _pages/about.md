Dr. Hongxun Hui is a Post-doctoral Fellow with the [State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City](https://skliotsc.um.edu.mo/), [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/). Previously, he received the Ph.D. and B. Eng degree both from the [College of Electrical Engineering](http://ee.zju.edu.cn/index.php), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) in 2020 and 2015, respectively. 

From 2015 to 2020, he was a member of Smart Grid Operation and Optimization Laboratory (SGOOL), supervised by Prof. [Yi Ding](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/110) and Prof. [Yonghua Song](https://rto.um.edu.mo/biography/). From 2018 to 2019, he was a visiting student at the [Advanced Research Institute](https://ari.vt.edu/ari_people/hongxun_hui.html) in [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/), supervised by Prof. [Saifur Rahman](http://www.saifurrahman.org/). He was elected in the 1st batch of the Academic Rising Star Program for Ph.D. students in Zhejiang University in 2018. He has authored or coauthored 1 international book, 40 authored/co-authored papers (including more than 20 SCI journal papers) and 15 issued patents. One of his paper was selected as the ESI Highly Cited Papers (Top 1%). 

He serves as reviewers for many international journals, including IEEE, IET, CSEE, Elsevier, Springer, and Wiley. He was the recipient of the Outstanding Reviewer Award from *Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy* in 2019. Besides, he was the Vice President of *IEEE Industry Applications Society Student Branch Chapter* from 2018 to 2020 in Zhejiang University, and the Director of *IEEE PES Electric Vehicle Satellite Committee-China*, *Energy and Transportation Nexus Subcommittee*.

Dr. Hongxun Hui's research interests are about the optimal control and market mechanism design of flexible loads (especially the heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning loads) considering high penetration of renewable energies in smart grid, specifically including the modeling and control method of flexible loads, the electricity market considering demand response, and the reliability analysis considering multiple uncertainties brought by flexible loads and renewable energies.
